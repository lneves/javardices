Obsolete JDBC wrapper / Connection pool. Kept around for legacy reasons.

Alternative to use are [HikariCP](http://brettwooldridge.github.io/HikariCP/) for connection pooling and [Sql2o](http://www.sql2o.org/) or [jOOQ](http://www.jooq.org/) for JDBC boilerplate code elimination.

 [JDBI](http://jdbi.org/) may also be a good choice.
